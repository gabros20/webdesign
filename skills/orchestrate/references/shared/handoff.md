# Handoff — compacting a dying context into a fresh one

When a stage's context is nearly spent (or you're partitioning work across fresh sessions), write
a handoff FILE and re-dispatch fresh. Never let a degraded context keep driving.

## Principles

1. **State, not instructions** — "logout endpoint is not yet implemented", never "implement
   logout next". The fresh agent decides actions; you give ground truth.
2. **Reference, don't duplicate** — point to briefs/reports/ledger/ADRs/PRs by path; re-embedding
   them makes the handoff stale and bloated.
3. **Capture the WHY** — decisions made and approaches REJECTED (with reasons) are the least
   recoverable information. Traps & dead ends save the successor from re-paying them.
4. **Trust nothing blindly** — frame claims as context to verify against code, not facts.
5. **Redact secrets**; reference where credentials live, never values.
6. **Be ruthless** — cut anything the next agent can trivially get from the code, the ledger, or
   project config.

## Template (`.orchestrate/handoff-<stage>.md`)

```
# HANDOFF: <title>          Session focus: <one line>
## Goal                     (1–3 sentences, the north star)
## Current state            DONE / PARTIAL / NOT STARTED — as status, not actions
## Key decisions (why)      chose X over Y because …
## Traps & dead ends        tried A — failed because …; do NOT do B
## Files & pointers         path:lines — what's there; ledger; reports; PRs
## Open work                remaining state + dependency order (not a command list)
## Prompt for the fresh agent
   Declarative background. End with: read every file listed above before acting;
   verify claims against the code; then wait for instructions.
```

## Probe-test before trusting it

After writing a handoff (or any compaction summary), probe it: can it answer — *which files
changed, at which revision? what was the original error? what's the next open item? what must
not change?* — from its own text + pointers? If not, regenerate. Artifact-trail loss is the
measured worst failure mode of compression.

## In this skill

- The ledger (`progress.md`) already carries per-task state — the handoff adds the WHY layer and
  cross-task context the ledger doesn't hold.
- Sub-orchestrators and long loop runs should write a handoff at budget exhaustion as part of
  stopping cleanly (`shared/safety-rails.md`).
